      This is a todo list app v1.0.0, it goes through some vue fundamentals, and
      full crud functionality via axios. I've got a lot of experience in Angular
      and React, so this was pretty easy to get a grasp on. Check out my Studio
      Ghibli api for some nice css, I wanted to learn the functionality here.
